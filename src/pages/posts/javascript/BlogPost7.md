In the realm of JavaScript programming, comprehending the execution context is fundamental for mastering how the language handles your code. This part of our exploration introduces the core concepts of JavaScript's execution context and its two main components.

#### What is an Execution Context?

JavaScript operates within an environment known as the execution context, which is pivotal for running code. This environment is split into two critical parts:

1. **Memory Space or Variable Environment**: This is where JavaScript stores all variables and functions as key-value pairs. The key is the name of the variable or function, and the value is the actual data or function definition.

2. **Code Space or Thread of Execution**: Here, JavaScript executes the code line by line in a synchronous, single-threaded manner. This means it processes one command at a time, waiting for a command to finish before moving to the next.

#### Best Practices in JavaScript

For more reliable and cleaner code, it's advisable to use `let` and `const` for variable declarations rather than `var`. This practice avoids various scope-related issues. Also, always try to move declarations and initializations to the top of your code to enhance readability and prevent hoisting issues.

#### The Execution Phases

When a JavaScript program is run, the JS engine creates the first, or global, execution context and processes the code in two main phases:

- **Memory Creation Phase**: During this initial run, memory space is allocated for all variables (set to undefined initially) and functions (where the function's entire code block is stored).
  
- **Code Execution Phase**: In this phase, JavaScript populates the actual values for variables and executes functions. When a function is called, JavaScript creates a new execution context for it, mimicking the global execution context process. This includes memory allocation and actual execution, and once the function completes, its execution context is discarded.

This detailed look at JavaScript's execution context lays the groundwork for understanding more complex behaviors like hoisting and the call stack, which we will explore in Part 2.
